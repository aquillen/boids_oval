# boids_oval
Boids within a flexible mass/spring boundary p5.js

The boids have a repel and steer/alignments.  The boundary is soft, elastic and stiff (resists bending).
The boundary particles are damped (a velocity dependent force).

The boids can push on the boundary, and the boundary causes the boids to circulate.
A global rotational mode appears? 

Possible relevant for control of active particles in confined settings?
